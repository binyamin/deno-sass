/**
 * This module tries to mimic the behavior of [the Dart-Sass NPM
 * package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass). So, you might
 * want to visit [their documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/)
 * instead.
 *
 * ### Known Problems
 * - Currently, this module only supports the synchronous API.
 * This is often fine, since the async API is slower.
