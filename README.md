[![CI Results](https://github.com/binyamin/deno-sass/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/binyamin/deno-sass/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Usage

This module tries to mimic the behavior of [the Dart-Sass NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) ([docs](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/)). If it doesn't, consider it a bug.

### Known Problems

- Currently, this module only supports the synchronous API. This is often fine, since the async API is slower.
